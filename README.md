<h2>About me 😃</h2>
<!--Intro start-->

<p align="left">

### Engineering Background and Passion for Data Analysis
        
As an engineer, I’ve always been drawn to technology and numerical data. My transition to data analysis began during my time managing an industrial business, where I enhanced my skills with finance and administration courses. Later, I co-founded a retail perfumery, initially managing the construction of four stores and eventually joining the management team. Tackling financial and operational challenges sparked my passion for analyzing data, first with Excel and later with Power BI.

### Relocation to Germany and Remote Work

Seeking better opportunities, I emigrated to Germany, continuing to support the perfumery business remotely by analyzing costs, sales, and staff performance to guide decision-making. In Germany, I worked on home renovation projects while dedicating my free time to studying Business Intelligence and SQL, which ultimately inspired my career change to data analytics.

### Professional Growth in Data Analytics

At Masterschool’s Data Analytics Bootcamp, I honed my skills in tools like Tableau, SQL, Python, and Machine Learning. This training, combined with my retail experience, equips me to provide practical, data-driven solutions. I’ve applied:
   - SQL and Python for data cleaning and analysis.
   - Visualization tools like Tableau and Matplotlib for insights.
   - Machine Learning models such as K-Means for customer segmentation.

### What Drives Me

With a blend of business experience and technical expertise, I excel at turning data into actionable insights. I’m passionate about solving challenges and adding value through analytics, and I’m eager to contribute to impactful, data-driven projects.
